# Homepage Information Architecture Rationale
*Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: January 15, 2024*

## Executive Summary

Complete homepage IA overhaul to prioritize Yardura's unique differentiators (health insights + eco impact) while implementing A/B testing to validate the conversion impact. The new order elevates trust-building content before detailed features.

## Current IA Problems (Pre-Optimization)

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Quote Form Too Early** - Section 2 creates commitment pressure before value demonstration
2. **Why It Matters Too Low** - Section 7 (should be 3-4) - our unique health rationale buried
3. **Insights Too Low** - Section 8 (should be 4-5) - our unique tech differentiator hidden
4. **No Differentiators Section** - Missing dedicated unique value props section
5. **Weak Trust Flow** - Features presented before benefits and differentiators

### Conversion Flow Issues:
- **Trust â†’ Commitment â†’ Education** (current broken flow)
- Missing progressive disclosure of value proposition
- No dedicated differentiators section
- Social proof appears after FAQ (too late)

## New Homepage IA Order (Implemented)

### Variant A (Default - Why It Matters + Insights ABOVE How It Works):
```
1. Hero (value + trust chips + Primary CTA "Get My Quote")
2. Differentiators (Tech-enabled insights â€¢ Eco diversion â€¢ Reliability)
3. Why It Matters (parasites â†’ nutrient theft, blood signals, awareness)
4. Insights Preview (mini trend card, non-diagnostic disclaimer)
5. How It Works (3 steps + visit checklist)
6. Quote Teaser (inline â†’ deep-link to /quote)
7. Eco Impact (counters)
8. Testimonials (social proof)
9. FAQ (support)
10. Final CTA
```

### Variant B (A/B Test - Why It Matters + Insights BELOW How It Works):
```
1. Hero (value + trust chips + Primary CTA "Get My Quote")
2. Differentiators (Tech-enabled insights â€¢ Eco diversion â€¢ Reliability)
3. How It Works (3 steps + visit checklist)
4. Why It Matters (parasites â†’ nutrient theft, blood signals, awareness)
5. Insights Preview (mini trend card, non-diagnostic disclaimer)
6. Quote Teaser (inline â†’ deep-link to /quote)
7. Eco Impact (counters)
8. Testimonials (social proof)
9. FAQ (support)
10. Final CTA
```

## Section-by-Section Rationale

### 1. Hero Section (Unchanged Position)
**Rationale:** First impression, establishes credibility, primary conversion point
**Strategy:** Keep value-focused headline, maintain trust signals, clear primary CTA
**A/B Consideration:** Test headline variations separately from layout

### 2. Differentiators Section (NEW)
**Rationale:** Build trust before deep diving into features
**Content:** 3 key differentiators with icons and benefit-focused copy
- **Tech-Enabled Insights:** AI stool analysis (non-diagnostic)
- **Eco-Friendly Disposal:** Landfill diversion through composting
- **Reliable & Trusted:** Licensed, insured, satisfaction guarantee

### 3-4. Why It Matters + Insights (ELEVATED - KEY CHANGE)
**Rationale:** These are Yardura's unique competitive advantages
- **Health Awareness:** Early detection of parasites, nutrient theft, blood signals
- **Tech Differentiation:** AI-powered stool insights (non-diagnostic)
- **Trust Building:** Shows we care about pet health, not just clean yards

### 5. How It Works (REPOSITIONED)
**Rationale:** Process education after value demonstration
**Strategy:** Moved down to allow differentiators to shine first

### 6. Quote Teaser (NEW - REPLACES EARLY FORM)
**Rationale:** Soft conversion attempt with low commitment
**Strategy:** Interactive pricing preview, benefit-focused CTAs, deep-link to /quote
**Benefits:** Reduces pressure, provides value before commitment

### 7-9. Eco Impact, Testimonials, FAQ (Optimized Flow)
**Rationale:** Trust-building content in logical progression
**Strategy:** Social proof before FAQ, environmental impact prominently placed

### 10. Final CTA (REPOSITIONED)
**Rationale:** Hard conversion close after full value demonstration

## A/B Testing Implementation

### Test Design:
**Test ID:** `homepage_layout`
**Variants:** A (Why It Matters + Insights above) vs B (below)
**Assignment:** 50/50 random with cookie persistence
**Duration:** Ongoing with statistical significance tracking

### URL Override:
- `?layoutVariant=A` - Force Variant A
- `?layoutVariant=B` - Force Variant B

### Tracking Events:
```javascript
// Variant assignment
track('ab_test_variant_assigned', {
  test_id: 'homepage_layout',
  variant: 'A' | 'B'
});

// Conversion tracking
track('quote_start', {
  source: 'hero' | 'teaser' | 'final_cta',
  variant: 'A' | 'B'
});
```

### Success Metrics:
**Primary KPI:** Quote form completion rate (+40% target)
**Secondary KPIs:**
- Time on page (+30%)
- Scroll depth to Quote Teaser
- Bounce rate (-25%)
- Variant preference in analytics

## Conversion Flow Optimization

### New User Journey:
```
Awareness â†’ Trust â†’ Value Demo â†’ Soft Commit â†’ Hard Commit
```

### Progressive Disclosure:
1. **Hero:** Basic value proposition
2. **Differentiators:** Unique advantages
3. **Why It Matters:** Health benefits
4. **Insights:** Tech demonstration
5. **How It Works:** Process clarity
6. **Quote Teaser:** Soft conversion
7. **Eco Impact:** Values alignment
8. **Social Proof:** Trust reinforcement
9. **FAQ:** Objection handling
10. **Final CTA:** Commitment close

### Trust Building Sequence:
```
Trust Signals â†’ Differentiators â†’ Health Benefits â†’ Process â†’ Social Proof
```

## Technical Implementation

### A/B Testing Hook:
```typescript
const { Component: LayoutComponent, variant, track } = useABTest({
  testId: 'homepage_layout',
  variants: { A: LayoutVariantA, B: LayoutVariantB },
  defaultVariant: 'A'
});
```

### Cookie Persistence:
- 30-day cookie storage
- Cross-session variant consistency
- Override via URL parameter

## Expected Performance Impact

### Conversion Metrics:
- **Quote Starts:** +25-40% (from better positioning)
- **Completion Rate:** +20-35% (from trust building)
- **Time on Page:** +20-35% (from content engagement)

### SEO Impact:
- **Better Engagement:** Lower bounce rate improves rankings
- **Content Authority:** Health-focused content builds topical authority
- **User Signals:** Improved dwell time and scroll depth

### User Experience:
- **Reduced Anxiety:** Trust before commitment
- **Clearer Value Prop:** Differentiators prominently displayed
- **Logical Flow:** Progressive information disclosure
- **Higher Satisfaction:** Better alignment with user intent

## Testing & Validation

### A/B Test Monitoring:
- Daily conversion tracking by variant
- Statistical significance calculation
- User feedback collection
- Heatmap analysis of engagement

### Performance Monitoring:
- Core Web Vitals impact
- Loading time by variant
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance

### Content Performance:

## Rollback Strategy

### Quick Rollback:
```bash

?layoutVariant=B

# Or update defaultVariant in useABTest hook
defaultVariant: 'B'
```

### Gradual Rollback:
- Reduce Variant A traffic to 10%
