# Yardura Pricing Rationale & Strategy
*Version 1.0 | Last Updated: August 30, 2025*

## Executive Summary

Yardura pricing strategy balances competitive positioning with premium value delivery. $20 weekly per dog positions us as premium alternative to budget competitors ($14-18 range) while justifying higher price through included eco diversion and health insights. Multiplier system (EOW ×1.25, 2× weekly ×0.9) reflects service economics and market expectations.

## Core Pricing Philosophy

### Premium Value Proposition
**Positioning**: Premium eco-focused service vs. budget commodity service
**Justification**: Included eco diversion + basic insights vs. competitors
**Target Market**: Quality-conscious homeowners valuing environmental impact

### Service Economics Reality
**Bi-weekly Logic**: Higher per-visit cost due to:
- Two weeks waste accumulation requires more time/effort
- Less route efficiency (fewer stops per route)
- Industry standard multiplier: 25-35% increase

**Twice-weekly Logic**: Slight discount due to:
- Route density benefits (more stops per route)
- Operational efficiency from frequent visits
- Competitive pressure from volume services

## Detailed Pricing Structure

### Base Matrix (Weekly, Medium Yard)
```
Dogs | Price | Incremental
  1  | $20  | -
  2  | $24  | +$4
  3  | $28  | +$4
  4  | $32  | +$4
```
**Rationale**: Linear scaling with efficiency loss at higher dog counts. $4 increment reflects marginal service cost.

### Yard Size Economics
```
Size    | Adder | Rationale
Small   | $0   | Baseline efficiency
Medium  | $0   | Standard service area
Large   | +$4  | Extended time/coverage
XL      | +$8  | Significant additional effort
```
**Rationale**: Larger yards require more time for thorough service. XL represents 2× large yard effort.

### Frequency Multipliers
```
Frequency      | Multiplier | Per-Visit Impact | Monthly Impact
Weekly         | ×1.0      | Base rate        | Highest total
Every-other-wk | ×1.25     | +25% per visit   | -50% total
Twice-weekly   | ×0.9      | -10% per visit   | +80% total
```

#### Bi-weekly (×1.25) Economics
**Service Reality**:
- 2 weeks accumulation = more waste volume
- Route planning less efficient (fewer stops)
- Travel time between fewer customers
- Customer concentration varies

**Market Validation**:
- Dog Gone: Weekly $13.99 → EOW $18.99 (+35%)
- ScoopyPoo: Weekly $18.50 → EOW $24.50 (+32%)
- **Yardura**: Weekly $20 → EOW $25 (+25%)

**Business Impact**: Balances service costs with customer savings (2 visits vs 4)

#### Twice-weekly (×0.9) Economics
**Service Benefits**:
- Higher route density (more customers per route)
- Reduced travel time between stops
- Consistent service schedule
- Better cash flow predictability

**Market Context**:
- Dog Gone offers 2× weekly at $11.99 (+14% discount)
- **Yardura**: Modest 10% discount reflects operational benefits

### Add-on Pricing
```
Service        | Price | Rationale
Deodorizer     | +$5  | Premium treatment, supplies cost
Litter Service | +$5  | Specialized service, separate handling
```
**Rationale**: Consistent $5 adder for premium services. Reflects material and handling costs.

### Initial Clean Economics
**Multiplier**: 2.5× per-visit rate
**Minimum**: $89 (protects service quality)
**Rationale**:
- Deep cleaning requires 2-3× normal effort
- Customer acquisition investment
- Sets quality expectations

## Competitive Positioning

### Market Segmentation
